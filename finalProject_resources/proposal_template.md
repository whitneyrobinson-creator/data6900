### **The Final Proposal Template ("The Black Book")**
**Use this structure to assemble your Week 13 Deliverable.**

#### **SECTION 1: THE EXECUTIVE BRIEFING**
*(Paste your polished "Minto Pyramid" Summary here. Focus on the Bottom Line.)*

#### **SECTION 2: THE "CHALLENGE & PIVOT" NARRATIVE**
*The story of your resilience. Use the STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).*

#### **SECTION 3: SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE & SAFETY**
*Insert your V3.0 Logic Map here.*

**The Data Hygiene Certificate (Copy/Paste/Sign):**
> "I, [Your Name], Lead Consultant, certify that the workflow delivered herein adheres to the strict data privacy standards defined in the project scope. Specifically:
> 1. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is transmitted to third-party LLMs without anonymization via the 'Set Node' protocol.
> 2. All temporary execution data is configured to purge after 72 hours.
> 3. API Credentials are stored in the n8n Credential Manager and are not hard-coded."
>
> **Signed:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Date:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### **SECTION 4: THE BUSINESS CASE**
*(Insert your Final ROI Excel Export here. Add a line for "Actual TCO" observed during testing.)*

#### **SECTION 5: GOVERNANCE & MAINTENANCE GUIDE (SOP)**
*It’s not just a manual; it’s a survival guide for the client.*

> **1. Operational SOP:**
> *   **How to Run:** [Instructions]
> *   **How to Modify Prompts:** Go to Node [X] and edit the System Message.
>
> **2. The Escalation Matrix (Who to call):**
> *   **Level 1 (Minor Bug):** Check the Execution Logs.
> *   **Level 2 (API Failure):** Contact the API Provider (OpenAI status page).
> *   **Level 3 (Reputational Risk):** If the bot hallucinates, activate the **Kill Switch**: [Describe manual override].
>
> **3. Ownership & Billing:**
> *   **API Credit Card Holder:** [Name/Role]
> *   **n8n License Owner:** [Name/Role]

#### **SECTION 6: FUTURE ROADMAP (The Upsell)**
*We delivered the MVP. What is the Ferrari version?*

> **Phase 2 Recommendations:**
> "To scale this solution from [Current Scope] to [Future Scope], we recommend the following upgrades:"
> 1.  **Feature:** [e.g., Voice Integration / ERP Sync].
> 2.  **Benefit:** [e.g., "Allows Lao Wang to approve refunds while driving"].
> 3.  **Estimated Impact:** [e.g., "Additional 20% efficiency gain"].

#### **SECTION 7: TECHNICAL APPENDIX (The Hand-Off)**
*This is the "Evidence Locker." It must contain the raw assets for IT to rebuild the system.*

> **7.1 The Code Repository (n8n Source Code)**
> *   **Action:** Paste the full JSON export of your final n8n workflow here (or provide a GitHub link/zip file reference).
> *   *Note:* This allows IT to import your work into a new server instance instantly.
>
> **7.2 The Prompt Library (Intellectual Property)**
> *   **System Prompt V3.0 (Worker):** [Copy/Paste the final Worker prompt].
> *   **System Prompt V3.0 (Auditor):** [Copy/Paste the final Auditor prompt].
> *   *Why:* Prompts are the "Software Code" of AI. They must be documented separately from the platform.
>
> **7.3 The Validation Suite (Safety Evidence)**
> *   **The Attack Log:** [Insert Week 5 Red Team Log].
> *   **The Unit Tests:** [Insert Week 12 Execution Log screenshots showing successful Error Handling].
>
> **7.4 The Design History**
> *   **As-Is Process Map:** [Insert Week 2 Diagram] (To show the manual baseline).
> *   **To-Be Logic Map:** [Insert Final Week 13 Diagram] (To show the architecture).
>
> **7.5 API Manifest**
> *   **List of Services:** (e.g., OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack).
> *   **Scope of Permissions:** (e.g., "Slack Bot needs 'Write' permissions to channel #refunds").
> *   *Note:* Do **NOT** include the actual secrets/keys here. Only list *what* keys are needed.

**7.6 The Development Effort Ledger (The Receipt)**
*Break down the "Investment Cost" you cited in the Business Case. This proves your TCO calculation is based on reality, not guessing.*

| **Phase** | **Activity** | **Hours Spent** | **Imputed Cost** (@ $50/hr) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy** | Process Mapping & Problem Framing (Wk 1-2) | \_\_\_ hrs | $ \_\_\_\_\_ |
| **Design** | Logic Design & Prompt Engineering (Wk 3-6) | \_\_\_ hrs | $ \_\_\_\_\_ |
| **Build** | n8n Configuration & API Setup (Wk 7-11) | \_\_\_ hrs | $ \_\_\_\_\_ |
| **Test** | Debugging, Red Teaming & Optimization (Wk 12-13) | \_\_\_ hrs | $ \_\_\_\_\_ |
| **Documentation** | Creating the SOP & Final Proposal | \_\_\_ hrs | $ \_\_\_\_\_ |
| **TOTAL** | | **\_\_\_ HRS** | **$ \_\_\_\_\_** |

*   *Note to Student:* This "Total Imputed Cost" must match the "Initial Dev Cost" line in your ROI Excel Sheet (Section 4).
