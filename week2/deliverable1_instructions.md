# Week 2 Assignment Instructions 

**Assignment:** Milestone 1 - Process Analysis
**Due:** Before Week 3 Live Session.
**Deliverable:** Completed PDD (Markdown/PDF).

**The Mission:**
You are Consultants. Your first job is not to build, but to **Diagnose**. You must analyze a current manual workflow (your team's chosen personal task) and prove that it is worth automating.
> Your goal is to identify your Minimal Viable Workflow (MVW)—the smallest slice of the process that provides immediate ROI.

**Steps:**
1.  **Select a Workflow:** Pick a repetitive personal task (e.g., "Processing Job Applications," "Meal Planning," "Summarizing Newsletters").
2.  **Map the "As-Is":**
    *   Use the **Interactive Planning** prompt to interview yourself about how you do this task manually.
    *   Generate a **Mermaid Diagram** of the current mess.
    *   **Crucial:** Mark the "Pain Points" in the diagram.
3.  **Analyze the Opportunity:**
    *   Run the "3 Filters" (Value, Feasibility, Risk).
    *   Justify *why* this needs Generative AI (reasoning/text) versus just a simple script.
4.  **Submit:** The PDD (Milestone 1).

**Grading Rubric (10%):**
*   **Process Mapping (4 pts):** Diagram clearly represents the "As-Is" process and highlights non-obvious pain points.
*   **Opportunity Analysis (4 pts):** Persuasively justifies *why* this is a good fit for GenAI (Pain + LLM Capability + Business Goal).
*   **Clarity (2 pts):** The problem is well-defined and the scope is realistic.
