## **Artifact 3: The Coaching Session Protocol**
**Purpose:** The script for the mandatory Instructor-Student meeting (2 weeks prior to their presentation slot). So I can help you become the "master teacher" more **efficiently**.

**MEETING LOGISTICS**
*   **Timing:** 2 Weeks before presentation.
*   **Duration:** 30 Minutes (Hard stop).
*   **Prerequisite:** Team must bring their **Working JSON**, **Lesson Plan**, and **Draft Class Handout**.

**MEETING AGENDA**

**1. The Tech Certification (10 Minutes)**
*   **The Live Run:** Student shares screen. Runs the workflow from start to finish.
    *   *Pass Criteria:* No errors, logical flow.
*   **The "Source of Truth" Audit:**
    *   *Instructor Question:* "Show me the **Official n8n Documentation** page you based this on."
    *   *Verification:* Ensure they aren't using deprecated nodes from an old YouTube video.
*   **The Golden File:**
    *   *Action:* Student exports the JSON *right now* and sends it to the Instructor.
    *   *Instructor:* "I will load this later. If it runs on my machine, you are Certified."

**2. The Pedagogy Audit (10 Minutes)**
*   **The Pre-Watch Video:**
    *   *Review:* Watch the 5-minute video the students selected.
    *   *Decision:* Is it accurate? Is the audio clear? (Approve/Reject).
*   **The "Student Cheat Sheet" (Handout):**
    *   *Review:* Look at the document the class will use. Are the API keys/URLs easy to copy-paste? Is the code legible?
*   **The "Hands-Off" Check:**
    *   *Instructor Question:* "Show me on your timeline exactly **when** you will ask the class to stop typing and listen to the strategy. You need two of these moments."

**3. The "Crash" Plan (5 Minutes)**
*   **Scenario:** Instructor poses a threat (e.g., "The OpenAI API is down," or "Half the class gets a 403 Forbidden error").
*   **Defense:** Student must explain their backup plan (e.g., "We have a static JSON response file ready to inject into the next node so we can skip the API call").

**4. Role Definition (5 Minutes)**
*   **For Cycle 1 Teams (Weeks 7-9):**
    *   "I am your **Co-Pilot**. I will actively interrupt if I see the class getting confused. I will help you debug live."
*   **For Cycle 2 Teams (Weeks 10-12):**
    *   "I am a **Silent Observer**. You own the room. If the demo crashes, you must debug it or pivot. Practice your troubleshooting."
