## **Artifact 2: The Student Presenter Guide (The Speaker’s Kit)**
**Purpose:** The definitive manual for the student teams on "How to Teach."

**DATA 6900: STUDENT PRESENTER GUIDE**

**Your Mission:**
You are the Corporate Trainer. Your goal is not to "show off" what you built; it is to ensure **100% of the class builds it with you**. If they get lost, you fail the engagement.

**The "Source of Truth" Rule:**
*   **Primary Authority:** You **MUST** base your technical configurations on the **[Official n8n Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/)**.
*   **Secondary Sources:** YouTube, Reddit, and Community Forums are great for *ideas*, but they are often outdated. If a YouTuber uses a node version that doesn't match the current Official Docs, you must use the Official Docs version.
*   *Why?* As consultants, relying on outdated blog posts creates liability. We build on the vendor's official specs.

**The 4 Mandatory Deliverables (Due at the 2-Week Coaching Session):**
1.  **The Pre-Watch Video:** You must find a high-quality 5-10 minute tutorial (YouTube or Official n8n) that explains the core concept. The class will watch this *before* you speak to establish a baseline.
2.  **The "Golden File" (JSON):** You must build your tutorial workflow *completely* in n8n, export the JSON, and submit it. The Instructor will test this file. If it works, it becomes the class's "Safety Net."
3.  **The Cheat Sheet:** A one-page doc for the class containing API URLs, sample JSON data, and code snippets they will need to copy-paste during your session.
4.  **The Lesson Plan:** A timeline of your 75 minutes.

**Pedagogical Requirements (The Rubric):**
*   **The "Hands-Off" Rule:** At least **twice** during your session, you must ask the class to take their hands off the keyboard. During this time, explain the **WHY** (Strategic Logic) behind the node, not just the **HOW** (Configuration).
*   **Resilience:** Your demo must handle at least one "Expected Error" (e.g., what if the data is missing?).
*   **Efficiency Strategy:** Be prepared to defend your choices. Why did you use an LLM here? Could a simple Logic Node have done it cheaper?

**The "Power User" Challenge (Optional):**
*   For the **Week 12** team (or any team feeling brave): If you successfully teach the class how to use a **Code Node** (JavaScript/Python) to solve a complex data problem, you earn the **"Tech Lead" Badge** (Bonus consideration).
